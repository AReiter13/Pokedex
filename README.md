# Pokedex

Welcome to the Pokédex! Input a .jpg image of any of the first 75 Pokémon registered in the official Pokédex, and our Pokédex application will identify and
display your Pokémon, just like the real thing!







This application was created as a project for the University of British Columbia in a team of four including shirleyqi26, Dylan-e, vicky208, and myself.
